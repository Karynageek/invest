                        Primarily, banks offer two kinds of deposit accounts. These are demand deposits like current/saving account and term deposits like fixed or recurring deposits. When you open a deposit account in a bank, you become an account holder or a depositor.

Saving accounts are used to meet daily on-demand requirements of cash. For example, you hold a saving bank account with the bank having cheque book facility. The bank asks you to maintain a minimum balance of Rs 1000. In return, the bank pays you an interest at the rate of 4% per annum.

You may operate the saving account using an ATM card also. Banks impose limits on the frequency and amount of withdrawal using ATMs.

The deposit rates on saving account keeps changing based on RBI’s revision of policy rates. Banks offer lower interest rates on saving account as compared to term deposits. It is because of this reason, investors opt for term deposit accounts.

A term deposit account is used to hold money for a fixed period of time. In return for this, the bank pays interest on the term deposits. However, you are not allowed to withdraw your money before expiry of the fixed duration.

For example, you hold a fixed deposit (FD) of Rs 10,000 for a period of five years with the bank. In return, the bank pays you an interest at the rate of 10% per annum.
